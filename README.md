# my-python-portfolio

This repository stores small Python projects I coded throughout 1 year of learning Python.

Recommend to first look at: tictactoe, otherAlgorithms/BFS.py, otherAlgorithms/weightedBFS.py

Some other of them are:
- basic algorithms for solving optimisation problems 
- knapsack problem solver
- algorithm to find all permutations of a set
- bisection search
- a word game in terminal (using OOP)
- caesar cipher
- probabalistic simulation of population
- random walks

- JavaScript OOP tic-tac-toe
- CSS dropdowns

- shortest path on a 2d grid
- shortest path on a 2d weighted grid
- algorithm to check if a Seabattle board is valid
- generating random graph and doing breadth first search
